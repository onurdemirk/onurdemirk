# Hi, I'm Onur.

I'm a **Front-End Developer** specialized in **React & JavaScript**, transitioning from nearly four years as an **SAP CX Technical Consultant**

---

## About Me

I successfully completed the front-end curriculum of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

I'm also actively learning **Node.js** to expand my back-end development capabilities.

My previous consulting background sharpened my problem-solving skills and adaptability. Now, I'm excited to bring these qualities into front-end development, where I craft user-centric web interfaces.

I'm open to new opportunities where I can grow as a developer and contribute to innovative projects.
